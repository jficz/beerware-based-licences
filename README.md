# Beerware no-warrany and no-patents

Why another license? [Beerware license](https://people.freebsd.org/~phk/) is good but it lacks both no-warrany and no-patent clauses.

No-warranty might be important if you live or operate in a state or country which imposes 
warranties upon you by default.

No-patents is purely ideological clause that, in theory, should make your work not usable
by patent trolls and hostile patent claimers (like Oracle, Microsoft, etc.)

This is an open-source, no fuss, attribution-only kind of license which allows commercial use and distribution of the code (or whatever you impose the license on).
